Assume we have two indexes, 'main' and 'delta'.\r\nAssume that documents 2, 3, and 5 were deleted since last reindex of 'main',\r\nand documents 7 and 11 were updated (ie. their text contents were changed).\r\nAssume that a keyword 'test' occurred in all these mentioned documents\r\nwhen we were indexing 'main'; still occurs in document 7 as we index 'delta';\r\nbut does not occur in document 11 any more. We now reindex delta and then\r\nsearch through both these indexes in proper (least to most recent) order:\r\n\r\n$res = $cl->Query ( \"test\", \"main delta\" );\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, we need to properly handle deletions. The result set should not\r\ncontain documents 2, 3, or 5. Second, we also need to avoid phantom results.\r\nUnless we do something about it, document 11 will\r\nappear in search results! It will be found in 'main' (but not 'delta').\r\nAnd it will make it to the final result set unless something stops it.\r\n\r\nKill-list, or K-list for short, is that something. Kill-list attached\r\nto 'delta' will suppress the specified rows from all the preceding\r\nindexes, in this case just 'main'. So to get the expected results,\r\nwe should put all the updated and deleted\r\ndocument IDs into it.\r\n\r\nNote that in the distributed index setup, K-lists are local\r\nto every node in the cluster. They are not get transmitted\r\nover the network when sending queries. (Because that might be too much\r\nof an impact when the K-list is huge.) You will need to setup a\r\nseparate per-server K-lists in that case.\r\nExample:\r\nsql_query_killlist = \\\r\n    SELECT id FROM documents WHERE updated_ts>=@last_reindex UNION \\\r\n    SELECT id FROM documents_deleted WHERE deleted_ts>=@last_reindex"

It's syntax is as follows:\r\n\r\nsql_joined_field = FIELD-NAME 'from'  ( 'query' | 'payload-query' \\\r\n    | 'ranged-query' ); QUERY [ ; RANGE-QUERY ]\r\n\r\nwhere\r\nFIELD-NAME is a joined/payload field name;\r\nQUERY is an SQL query that must fetch values to index.\r\nRANGE-QUERY is an optional SQL query that fetches a range\r\nof values to index. (Added in version 2.0.1-beta.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoined fields let you avoid JOIN and/or GROUP_CONCAT statements in the main\r\ndocument fetch query (sql_query). This can be useful when SQL-side JOIN is slow,\r\nor needs to be offloaded on Sphinx side, or simply to emulate MySQL-specific\r\nGROUP_CONCAT functionality in case your database server does not support it.\r\n\r\nThe query must return exactly 2 columns: document ID, and text to append\r\nto a joined field. Document IDs can be duplicate, but they must be\r\nin ascending order. All the text rows fetched for a given ID will be\r\nconcatenated together, and the concatenation result will be indexed\r\nas the entire contents of a joined field. Rows will be concatenated\r\nin the order returned from the query, and separating whitespace\r\nwill be inserted between them. For instance, if joined field query\r\nreturns the following rows:\r\n\r\n( 1, 'red' )\r\n( 1, 'right' )\r\n( 1, 'hand' )\r\n( 2, 'mysql' )\r\n( 2, 'sphinx' )\r\n\r\nthen the indexing results would be equivalent to that of adding\r\na new text field with a value of 'red right hand' to document 1 and\r\n'mysql sphinx' to document 2.\r\n\r\nJoined fields are only indexed differently. There are no other differences\r\nbetween joined fields and regular text fields.\r\n\r\nStarting with 2.0.1-beta, ranged queries can be used when\r\na single query is not efficient enough or does not work because of\r\nthe database driver limitations. It works similar to the ranged\r\nqueries in the main indexing loop, see Section\_3.8, “Ranged queries”.\r\nThe range will be queried for and fetched upfront once,\r\nthen multiple queries with different $start\r\nand $end substitutions will be run to fetch\r\nthe actual data.\r\n\r\nPayloads let you create a special field in which, instead of\r\nkeyword positions, so-called user payloads are stored. Payloads are\r\ncustom integer values attached to every keyword. They can then be used\r\nin search time to affect the ranking.\r\n\r\nThe payload query must return exactly 3 columns: document ID; keyword;\r\nand integer payload value. Document IDs can be duplicate, but they must be\r\nin ascending order. Payloads must be unsigned integers within 24-bit range,\r\nie. from 0 to 16777215. For reference, payloads are currently internally\r\nstored as in-field keyword positions, but that is not guaranteed\r\nand might change in the future.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the only method to account for payloads is to use\r\nSPH_RANK_PROXIMITY_BM25 ranker. On indexes with payload fields,\r\nit will automatically switch to a variant that matches keywords\r\nin those fields, computes a sum of matched payloads multiplied\r\nby field weights, and adds that sum to the final rank.\r\nExample:\r\nsql_joined_field = \\\r\n    tagstext from query; \\\r\n    SELECT docid, CONCAT('tag',tagid) FROM tags ORDER BY docid ASC\r\n\r\nsql_joined_field = bigint tag from ranged-query; \\\r\n    SELECT id, tag FROM tags WHERE id>=$start AND id<=$end; \\\r\n    SELECT MIN(id), MAX(id) FROM tags ORDER BY docid ASC"

Essentially, this directive controls how exactly master does the\r\nload balancing between the configured mirror agent nodes.\r\nAs of 2.1.1-beta, the following strategies are implemented:\r\nSimple random balancingha_strategy = random\r\nThe default balancing mode. Simple linear random distribution among the mirrors.\r\nThat is, equal selection probability are assigned to every mirror. Kind of similar\r\nto round-robin (RR), but unlike RR, does not impose a strict selection order.\r\nAdaptive randomized balancing\r\nThe default simple random strategy does not take mirror status, error rate,\r\nand, most importantly, actual response latencies into account. So to accommodate\r\nfor heterogeneous clusters and/or temporary spikes in agent node load, we have\r\na group of balancing strategies that dynamically adjusts the probabilities\r\nbased on the actual query latencies observed by the master.\r\n\r\nThe adaptive strategies based on latency-weighted probabilities\r\nbasically work as follows:\r\nlatency stats are accumulated, in blocks of ha_period_karma seconds;\r\nonce per karma period, latency-weighted probabilities get recomputed;\r\nonce per request (including ping requests), \"dead or alive\" flag is adjusted.\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently (as of 2.1.1-beta), we begin with equal probabilities (or percentages,\r\nfor brevity), and on every step, scale them by the inverse of the latencies observed\r\nduring the last \"karma\" period, and then renormalize them.  For example, if during\r\nthe first 60 seconds after the master startup 4 mirrors had latencies of\r\n10, 5, 30, and 3 msec/query respectively, the first adjustment step\r\nwould go as follow:\r\ninitial percentages: 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.2%;\r\nobserved latencies: 10 ms, 5 ms, 30 ms, 3 ms;\r\ninverse latencies: 0.1, 0.2, 0.0333, 0.333;\r\nscaled percentages: 0.025, 0.05, 0.008333, 0.0833;\r\nrenormalized percentages: 0.15, 0.30, 0.05, 0.50.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeaning that the 1st mirror would have a 15% chance of being chosen during\r\nthe next karma period, the 2nd one a 30% chance, the 3rd one (slowest at 30 ms)\r\nonly a 5% chance, and the 4th and the fastest one (at 3 ms) a 50% chance.\r\nThen, after that period, the second adjustment step would update those chances\r\nagain, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe rationale here is, once the observed latencies stabilize,\r\nthe latency weighted probabilities stabilize as well. So all these\r\nadjustment iterations are supposed to converge at a point where the average\r\nlatencies are (roughly) equal over all mirrors.\r\nha_strategy = nodeads\r\nLatency-weighted probabilities, but dead mirrors are excluded from\r\nthe selection. \"Dead\" mirror is defined as a mirror that resulted\r\nin multiple hard errors (eg. network failure, or no answer, etc) in a row.\r\nha_strategy = noerrors\r\nLatency-weighted probabilities, but mirrors with worse errors/success ratio\r\nare excluded from the selection.\r\nRound-robin balancingha_strategy = roundrobinSimple round-robin selection, that is, selecting the 1st mirror\r\nin the list, then the 2nd one, then the 3rd one, etc, and then repeating\r\nthe process once the last mirror in the list is reached. Unlike with\r\nthe randomized strategies, RR imposes a strict querying order (1, 2, 3, ..,\r\nN-1, N, 1, 2, 3, ... and so on) and guarantees that\r\nno two subsequent queries will be sent to the same mirror."

        description: "Remote agent declaration in the distributed index.\r\nMulti-value, optional, default is empty.\r\n\r\nagent directive declares remote agents that are searched\r\nevery time when the enclosing distributed index is searched. The agents\r\nare, essentially, pointers to networked indexes. Prior to version 2.1.1-beta,\r\nthe value format was:\r\n\r\nagent = address:index-list\r\n\r\nStarting with 2.1.1-beta, the value can additionally specify multiple\r\nalternatives (agent mirrors) for either the address only, or the address\r\nand index list:\r\n\r\nagent = address1 [ | address2 [...] ]:index-list\r\nagent = address1:index-list [ | address2:index-list [...] ]\r\n\r\nIn both cases the address specification must be one of the following:\r\n\r\naddress = hostname:port # eg. server2:9312\r\naddress = /absolute/unix/socket/path # eg. /var/run/sphinx2.sock\r\n\r\nWhere\r\nhostname is the remote host name,\r\nport is the remote TCP port number,\r\nindex-list is a comma-separated list of index names,\r\nand square braces [] designate an optional clause.\r\n\r\nIn other words, you can point every single agent to one or more remote\r\nindexes, residing on one or more networked servers. There are absolutely\r\nno restrictions on the pointers. To point out a couple important things,\r\nthe host can be localhost, and the remote index can be a distributed\r\nindex in turn, all that is legal. That enables a bunch of very different\r\nusage modes:\r\nsharding over multiple agent servers, and creating\r\nan arbitrary cluster topology;\r\nsharding over multiple agent servers, mirrored\r\nfor HA/LB (High Availability and Load Balancing) purposes\r\n(starting with 2.1.1-beta);\r\nsharding within localhost, to utilize multiple cores\r\n(historical and not recommended in versions 1.x and above, use multiple\r\nlocal indexes and dist_threads directive instead);\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll agents are searched in parallel. An index list is passed verbatim\r\nto the remote agent. How exactly that list is searched within the agent\r\n(ie. sequentially or in parallel too) depends solely on the agent\r\nconfiguration (ie. dist_threads directive). Master has no remote\r\ncontrol over that.\r\nExample:\r\n# config on box2\r\n# sharding an index over 3 servers\r\nagent = box2:9312:chunk2\r\nagent = box3:9312:chunk3\r\n\r\n# config on box2\r\n# sharding an index over 3 servers\r\nagent = box1:9312:chunk2\r\nagent = box3:9312:chunk3\r\n\r\n# config on box3\r\n# sharding an index over 3 servers\r\nagent = box1:9312:chunk2\r\nagent = box2:9312:chunk3\r\nAgent mirrors\r\nNew syntax added in 2.1.1-beta lets you define so-called agent mirrors\r\nthat can be used interchangeably when processing a search query. Master server\r\nkeeps track of mirror status (alive or dead) and response times, and does\r\nautomatic failover and load balancing based on that. For example, this line:\r\nagent = box1:9312|box2:9312|box3:9312:chunk2\r\nDeclares that box1:9312, box2:9312, and box3:9312 all have an index\r\ncalled chunk2, and can be used as interchangeable mirrors. If any single\r\nof those servers go down, the queries will be distributed between\r\nthe other two. When it gets back up, master will detect that and begin\r\nrouting queries to all three boxes again.\r\n\r\nAnother way to define the mirrors is to explicitly specify the index list\r\nfor every mirror:\r\nagent = box1:9312:box1chunk2|box2:9312:box2chunk2\r\nThis works essentially the same as the previous example, but different\r\nindex names will be used when querying different severs: box1chunk2 when querying\r\nbox1:9312, and box2chunk when querying box2:9312.\r\n\r\nBy default, all queries are routed to the best of the mirrors. The best one\r\nis picked based on the recent statistics, as controlled by the\r\nha_period_karma config directive.\r\nMaster stores a number of metrics (total query count, error count, response\r\ntime, etc) recently observed for every agent. It groups those by time spans,\r\nand karma is that time span length. The best agent mirror is then determined\r\ndynamically based on the last 2 such time spans. Specific algorithm that\r\nwill be used to pick a mirror can be configured\r\nha_strategy directive.\r\n\r\nThe karma period is in seconds and defaults to 60 seconds. Master stores\r\nupto 15 karma spans with per-agent statistics for instrumentation purposes\r\n(see  SHOW AGENT STATUS\r\nstatement). However, only the last 2 spans out of those are ever used for\r\nHA/LB logic.\r\n\r\nWhen there are no queries, master sends a regular ping command every\r\nha_ping_interval milliseconds\r\nin order to have some statistics and at least check, whether the remote\r\nhost is still alive. ha_ping_interval defaults to 1000 msec. Setting it to 0\r\ndisables pings and statistics will only be accumulated based on actual queries.\r\nExample:\r\n# sharding index over 4 servers total\r\n# in just 2 chunks but with 2 failover mirrors for each chunk\r\n# box1, box2 carry chunk1 as local\r\n# box3, box4 carry chunk2 as local\r\n\r\n# config on box1, box2\r\nagent = box3:9312|box4:9312:chunk2\r\n\r\n# config on box3, box4\r\nagent = box1:9312|box2:9312:chunk1"

However, indexing prefixes will make the index grow significantly\r\n(because of many more indexed keywords), and will degrade both indexing\r\nand searching times.\r\n\r\nThere's no automatic way to rank perfect word matches higher\r\nin a prefix index, but there's a number of tricks to achieve that.\r\nFirst, you can setup two indexes, one with prefix indexing and one\r\nwithout it, search through both, and use SetIndexWeights()\r\ncall to combine weights. Second, you can rewriteyour extended-mode queries:\r\n\r\n$cl->Query ( \"( keyword | keyword* ) other keywords\" );\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nmin_prefix_len = 3"

        description: "Accepted characters table, with case folding rules.\r\nOptional, default value are latin and cyrillic characters.\r\n\r\ncharset_table is the main workhorse of Sphinx tokenizing process,\r\nie. the process of extracting keywords from document text or query text.\r\nIt controls what characters are accepted as valid and what are not,\r\nand how the accepted characters should be transformed (eg. should\r\nthe case be removed or not).\r\n\r\nYou can think of charset_table as of a big table that has a mapping\r\nfor each and every of 100K+ characters in Unicode. By default,\r\nevery character maps to 0, which means that it does not occur\r\nwithin keywords and should be treated as a separator. Once\r\nmentioned in the table, character is mapped to some other\r\ncharacter (most frequently, either to itself or to a lowercase\r\nletter), and is treated as a valid keyword part.\r\n\r\nThe expected value format is a commas-separated list of mappings.\r\nTwo simplest mappings simply declare a character as valid, and map\r\na single character to another single character, respectively.\r\nBut specifying the whole table in such form would result\r\nin bloated and barely manageable specifications. So there are\r\nseveral syntax shortcuts that let you map ranges of characters\r\nat once. The complete list is as follows:\r\nA->a\r\nSingle char mapping, declares source char 'A' as allowed\r\n        to occur within keywords and maps it to destination char 'a'\r\n        (but does not declare 'a' as allowed).\r\n    A..Z->a..z\r\nRange mapping, declares all chars in source range\r\n        as allowed and maps them to the destination range. Does not\r\n        declare destination range as allowed. Also checks ranges' lengths\r\n        (the lengths must be equal).\r\n    a\r\nStray char mapping, declares a character as allowed\r\n        and maps it to itself. Equivalent to a->a single char mapping.\r\n    a..z\r\nStray range mapping, declares all characters in range\r\n        as allowed and maps them to themselves. Equivalent to\r\n        a..z->a..z range mapping.\r\n    A..Z/2\r\nCheckerboard range map. Maps every pair of chars\r\n        to the second char. More formally, declares odd characters\r\n        in range as allowed and maps them to the even ones; also\r\n        declares even characters as allowed and maps them to themselves.\r\n        For instance, A..Z/2 is equivalent to A->B, B->B, C->D, D->D,\r\n        ..., Y->Z, Z->Z. This mapping shortcut is helpful for\r\n        a number of Unicode blocks where uppercase and lowercase\r\n        letters go in such interleaved order instead of contiguous\r\n        chunks.\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nControl characters with codes from 0 to 31 are always treated as separators.\r\nCharacters with codes 32 to 127, ie. 7-bit ASCII characters, can be used\r\nin the mappings as is. To avoid configuration file encoding issues,\r\n8-bit ASCII characters and Unicode characters must be specified in U+xxx form,\r\nwhere 'xxx' is hexadecimal codepoint number. This form can also be used\r\nfor 7-bit ASCII characters to encode special ones: eg. use U+20 to\r\nencode space, U+2E to encode dot, U+2C to encode comma.\r\n\r\nStarting with 2.2.3-beta, aliases \"english\" and \"russian\" are allowed at\r\ncontrol character mapping.\r\nExample:\r\n# default are English and Russian letters\r\ncharset_table = 0..9, A..Z->a..z, _, a..z, \\\r\n    U+410..U+42F->U+430..U+44F, U+430..U+44F, U+401->U+451, U+451\r\n\t\r\n# english charset defined with alias\r\ncharset_table = 0..9, english, _"

Thus, with\r\nthe example exceptions file above, \"at&t\" text will be tokenized as two\r\nkeywords \"at\" and \"t\", because of lowercase letters. On the other hand,\r\n\"AT&T\" will match exactly and produce single \"AT&T\" keyword.\r\n\r\nNote that this map-to keyword is a) always interpreted\r\nas a single word, and b) is both case and space\r\nsensitive! In our sample, \"ms windows\" query will not\r\nmatch the document with \"MS Windows\" text. The query will be interpreted\r\nas a query for two keywords, \"ms\" and \"windows\". And what \"MS Windows\"\r\ngets mapped to is a single keyword \"ms windows\",\r\nwith a space in the middle. On the other hand, \"standartenfuhrer\"\r\nwill retrieve documents with \"Standarten Fuhrer\" or \"Standarten Fuehrer\"\r\ncontents (capitalized exactly like this), or any capitalization variant\r\nof the keyword itself, eg. \"staNdarTenfUhreR\". (It won't catch\r\n\"standarten fuhrer\", however: this text does not match any of the\r\nlisted exceptions because of case sensitivity, and gets indexed\r\nas two separate keywords.)\r\n\r\nWhitespace in the map-from tokens list matters, but its amount does not.\r\nAny amount of the whitespace in the map-form list will match any other amount\r\nof whitespace in the indexed document or query. For instance, \"AT\_&\_T\"\r\nmap-from token will match \"AT\_\_\_\_&\_\_T\" text,\r\nwhatever the amount of space in both map-from part and the indexed text.\r\nSuch text will therefore be indexed as a special \"AT&T\" keyword,\r\nthanks to the very first entry from the sample.\r\n\r\nExceptions also allow to capture special characters (that are exceptions\r\nfrom general charset_table rules;\r\nhence the name). Assume that you generally do not want to treat '+'\r\nas a valid character, but still want to be able search for some exceptions\r\nfrom this rule such as 'C++'. The sample above will do just that, totally\r\nindependent of what characters are in the table and what are not.\r\n\r\nExceptions are applied to raw incoming document and query data\r\nduring indexing  and searching respectively. Therefore, to pick up\r\nchanges in the file it's required to reindex and restart\r\nsearchd.\r\nExample:\r\nexceptions = /usr/local/sphinx/data/exceptions.txt"

They also eliminate the chance of\r\nCRC32 collisions. In 2.0.1-beta, that mode was only supported\r\nfor disk indexes. Starting with 2.0.2-beta, RT indexes are\r\nalso supported.\r\n\r\nCRC dictionaries never store the original keyword text in the index.\r\nInstead, keywords are replaced with their control sum value (either CRC32 or\r\nFNV64, depending whether Sphinx was built with --enable-id64)\r\nboth when searching and indexing, and that value is used internally\r\nin the index.\r\n\r\nThat approach has two drawbacks. First, in CRC32 case there is\r\na chance of control sum collision between several pairs of different\r\nkeywords, growing quadratically with the number of unique keywords\r\nin the index. (FNV64 case is unaffected in practice, as a chance\r\nof a single FNV64 collision in a dictionary of 1 billion entries\r\nis approximately 1:16, or 6.25 percent. And most dictionaries\r\nwill be much more compact that a billion keywords, as a typical\r\nspoken human language has in the region of 1 to 10 million word\r\nforms.) Second, and more importantly, substring searches are not\r\ndirectly possible with control sums. Sphinx alleviated that by\r\npre-indexing all the possible substrings as separate keywords\r\n(see Section\_12.2.18, “min_prefix_len”, Section\_12.2.19, “min_infix_len”\r\ndirectives). That actually has an added benefit of matching\r\nsubstrings in the quickest way possible. But at the same time\r\npre-indexing all substrings grows the index size a lot (factors\r\nof 3-10x and even more would not be unusual) and impacts the\r\nindexing time respectively, rendering substring searches\r\non big indexes rather impractical.\r\n\r\nKeywords dictionary, introduced in 2.0.1-beta, fixes both these\r\ndrawbacks. It stores the keywords in the index and performs\r\nsearch-time wildcard expansion. For example, a search for a\r\n'test*' prefix could internally expand to 'test|tests|testing'\r\nquery based on the dictionary contents. That expansion is fully\r\ntransparent to the application, except that the separate\r\nper-keyword statistics for all the actually matched keywords\r\nwould now also be reported.\r\n\r\nVersion 2.1.1-beta introduced extended wildcards support, now special\r\nsymbols like '?' and '%' are supported along with substring (infix) search (e.g. \"t?st*\", \"run%\", \"*abc*\").\r\nNote, however, these wildcards work only with dict=keywords, and not elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIndexing with keywords dictionary should be 1.1x to 1.3x slower\r\ncompared to regular, non-substring indexing - but times faster\r\ncompared to substring indexing (either prefix or infix). Index size\r\nshould only be slightly bigger that than of the regular non-substring\r\nindex, with a 1..10% percent total difference.\r\nRegular keyword searching time must be very close or identical across\r\nall three discussed index kinds (CRC non-substring, CRC substring,\r\nkeywords). Substring searching time can vary greatly depending\r\non how many actual keywords match the given substring (in other\r\nwords, into how many keywords does the search term expand).\r\nThe maximum number of keywords matched is restricted by the\r\nexpansion_limit\r\ndirective.\r\n\r\nEssentially, keywords and CRC dictionaries represent the two\r\ndifferent trade-off substring searching decisions. You can choose\r\nto either sacrifice indexing time and index size in favor of\r\ntop-speed worst-case searches (CRC dictionary), or only slightly\r\nimpact indexing time but sacrifice worst-case searching time when\r\nthe prefix expands into very many keywords (keywords dictionary).\r\nExample:\r\ndict = keywords"

For instance, by looking at\r\n\"dove\" it is not possible to tell whether this is a past tense\r\nof \"dive\" the verb as in \"He dove into a pool.\", or \"dove\" the noun\r\nas in \"White dove flew over the cuckoo's nest.\" In this case\r\nlemmatizer can generate all the possible root forms.\r\n\r\nStemmer reduces a keyword form to a so-called stem\r\nby removing and/or replacing certain well-known suffixes.\r\nThe resulting stem is however notguaranteed to be\r\na valid word on itself. For instance, with a Porter English\r\nstemmers \"running\" would still reduce to \"run\", which is fine,\r\nbut \"business\" would reduce to \"busi\", which is not a word,\r\nand \"octopi\" would not reduce at all. Stemmers are essentially\r\n(much) simpler but still pretty good replacements of full-blown\r\nlemmatizers.\r\n\r\nPhonetic algorithms replace the words with specially\r\ncrafted phonetic codes that are equal even when the words original\r\nare different, but phonetically close.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe morphology processors that come with our own built-in Sphinx\r\nimplementations are:\r\nEnglish, Russian, and German lemmatizers;\r\nEnglish, Russian, Arabic, and Czech stemmers;\r\nSoundEx and MetaPhone phonetic algorithms.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also link with libstemmer library for even more\r\nstemmers (see details below). With libstemmer, Sphinx also supports\r\nmorphological processing for more than 15 other languages. Binary\r\npackages should come prebuilt with libstemmer support, too.\r\n\r\nLemmatizer support was added in version 2.1.1-beta, starting with\r\na Russian lemmatizer. English and German lemmatizers were then added\r\nin version 2.2.1-beta.\r\n\r\nLemmatizers require a dictionary that needs to be\r\nadditionally downloaded from the Sphinx website. That dictionary\r\nneeds to be installed in a directory specified by\r\nlemmatizer_base\r\ndirective. Also, there is a\r\nlemmatizer_cache\r\ndirective that lets you speed up lemmatizing (and therefore\r\nindexing) by spending more RAM for, basically, an uncompressed\r\ncache of a dictionary.\r\n\r\nChinese segmentation using Rosette Linguistics Platform was added in 2.2.1-beta.\r\nIt is a much more precise but slower way (compared to n-grams) to segment Chinese documents.\r\ncharset_table must contain all Chinese characters except\r\nChinese punctuation marks because incoming documents are first processed by sphinx tokenizer and then the result\r\nis processed by RLP. Sphinx performs per-token language detection on the incoming documents. If token language is\r\nidentified as Chinese, it will only be processed the RLP, even if multiple morphology processors are specified.\r\nOtherwise, it will be processed by all the morphology processors specified in the \"morphology\" option. Rosette\r\nLinguistics Platform must be installed and configured and sphinx must be built with a --with-rlp switch. See also\r\nrlp_root,\r\nrlp_environment and\r\nrlp_context options.\r\nA batched version of RLP segmentation is also available (rlp_chinese_batched). It provides the\r\nsame functionality as the basic rlp_chinese segmentation, but enables batching documents before\r\nprocessing them by the RLP. Processing several documents at once can result in a substantial indexing speedup if\r\nthe documents are small (for example, less than 1k). See also\r\nrlp_max_batch_size and\r\nrlp_max_batch_docs options.\r\n\r\nAdditional stemmers provided by Snowball\r\nproject libstemmer library\r\ncan be enabled at compile time using --with-libstemmer configure option.\r\nBuilt-in English and Russian stemmers should be faster than their\r\nlibstemmer counterparts, but can produce slightly different results,\r\nbecause they are based on an older version.\r\n\r\nSoundex implementation matches that of MySQL. Metaphone implementation\r\nis based on Double Metaphone algorithm and indexes the primary code.\r\n\r\nBuilt-in values that are available for use in morphology\r\noption are as follows:\r\nnone - do not perform any morphology processing;\r\nlemmatize_ru - apply Russian lemmatizer and pick a single root form (added in 2.1.1-beta);\r\nlemmatize_en - apply English lemmatizer and pick a single root form (added in 2.2.1-beta);\r\nlemmatize_de - apply German lemmatizer and pick a single root form (added in 2.2.1-beta);\r\nlemmatize_ru_all - apply Russian lemmatizer and index all possible root forms (added in 2.1.1-beta);\r\nlemmatize_en_all - apply Russian lemmatizer and index all possible root forms (added in 2.2.1-beta);\r\nlemmatize_de_all - apply Russian lemmatizer and index all possible root forms (added in 2.2.1-beta);\r\nstem_en - apply Porter's English stemmer;\r\nstem_ru - apply Porter's Russian stemmer;\r\nstem_enru - apply Porter's English and Russian stemmers;\r\nstem_cz - apply Czech stemmer;\r\nstem_ar - apply Arabic stemmer (added in 2.1.1-beta);\r\nsoundex - replace keywords with their SOUNDEX code;\r\nmetaphone - replace keywords with their METAPHONE code.\r\nrlp_chinese - apply Chinese text segmentation using Rosette Linguistics Platform\r\nrlp_chinese_batched - apply Chinese text segmentation using Rosette Linguistics Platform with document batching\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional values provided by libstemmer are in 'libstemmer_XXX' format,\r\nwhere XXX is libstemmer algorithm codename (refer to\r\nlibstemmer_c/libstemmer/modules.txt for a complete list).\r\n\r\nSeveral stemmers can be specified (comma-separated). They will be applied\r\nto incoming words in the order they are listed, and the processing will stop\r\nonce one of the stemmers actually modifies the word.\r\nAlso when wordforms feature is enabled\r\nthe word will be looked up in word forms dictionary first, and if there is\r\na matching entry in the dictionary, stemmers will not be applied at all.\r\nOr in other words, wordforms can be\r\nused to implement stemming exceptions.\r\nExample:\r\nmorphology = stem_en, libstemmer_sv"

It can either perform\r\nlemmatization off the compressed data, using more CPU but less RAM,\r\nor it can decompress and precache the dictionary either partially\r\nor fully, thus using less CPU but more RAM. And the lemmatizer_cache\r\ndirective lets you control how much RAM exactly can be spent for that\r\nuncompressed dictionary cache.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the only available dictionary is ru.pak, the Russian one.\r\nThe compressed dictionary is approximately 10 MB in size. Note that the\r\ndictionary stays in memory at all times, too. The default cache size\r\nis 256 KB. The accepted cache sizes are 0 to 2047 MB. It's safe to raise\r\nthe cache size too high; the lemmatizer will only use the needed memory.\r\nFor instance, the entire Russian dictionary decompresses to approximately\r\n110 MB; and thus setting lemmatizer_cache anywhere higher than that will\r\nnot affect the memory use: even when 1024 MB is allowed for the cache,\r\nif only 110 MB is needed, it will only use those 110 MB.\r\n\r\nOn our benchmarks, the total indexing time with different cache\r\nsizes was as follows:\r\n9.07 sec, morphology = lemmatize_ru, lemmatizer_cache = 0\r\n8.60 sec, morphology = lemmatize_ru, lemmatizer_cache = 256K\r\n8.33 sec, morphology = lemmatize_ru, lemmatizer_cache = 8M\r\n7.95 sec, morphology = lemmatize_ru, lemmatizer_cache = 128M\r\n6.85 sec, morphology = stem_ru (baseline)\r\n\r\n\r\nYour mileage may vary, but a simple rule of thumb would be to either\r\ngo with the small default 256 KB cache when pressed for memory, or spend\r\n128 MB extra RAM and cache the entire dictionary for maximum indexing\r\nperformance.\r\nExample:\r\nlemmatizer_cache = 256M # cache it all"

OPTION max_predicted_time,\r\nthat lets you limit the query time and get stable,\r\nrepeatable results. Instead of regularly checking the actual current time\r\nwhile evaluating the query, which is indeterministic, it predicts the current\r\nrunning time using a simple linear model instead:\r\n\r\npredicted_time =\r\n    doc_cost * processed_documents +\r\n    hit_cost * processed_hits +\r\n    skip_cost * skiplist_jumps +\r\n    match_cost * found_matches\r\n\r\nThe query is then terminated early when the predicted_time\r\nreaches a given limit.\r\n\r\nOf course, this is not a hard limit on the actual time spent (it is, however,\r\na hard limit on the amount of processing work done), and\r\na simple linear model is in no way an ideally precise one. So the wall clock time\r\nmay be either below or over the target limit. However,\r\nthe error margins are quite acceptable: for instance, in our experiments with\r\na 100 msec target limit the majority of the test queries fell into a 95 to 105 msec\r\nrange, and all of the queries were in a 80 to 120 msec range.\r\nAlso, as a nice side effect, using the modeled query time instead of measuring\r\nactual run time results in somewhat less gettimeofday() calls, too.\r\n\r\nNo two server makes and models are identical, so predicted_time_costs\r\ndirective lets you configure the costs for the model above. For convenience, they are\r\nintegers, counted in nanoseconds. (The limit in max_predicted_time is counted\r\nin milliseconds, and having to specify cost values as 0.000128 ms instead of 128 ns\r\nis somewhat more error prone.) It is not necessary to specify all 4 costs at once,\r\nas the missed one will take the default values. However, we strongly suggest\r\nto specify all of them, for readability.\r\nExample:\r\npredicted_time_costs = doc=128, hit=96, skip=4096, match=128"
